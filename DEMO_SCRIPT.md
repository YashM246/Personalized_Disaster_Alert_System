# Demo Script - Natural Disaster Alert System

**Total Duration:** ~3 minutes
**Target Audience:** Technical/Non-technical stakeholders

---

## Introduction (30 seconds)

**Opening Statement:**
"Emergency alerts can save lives, but only if people understand them. Today's disaster warnings use one-size-fits-all messaging that doesn't account for language barriers, education levels, or community needs.

I'm excited to show you an AI-powered disaster alert system that generates personalized emergency warnings tailored to each community's demographics."

---

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)

**The Challenge:**
"Consider these real scenarios:
- An 82% Spanish-speaking community in East LA receives alerts only in English
- Elderly residents with mobility issues get the same evacuation guidance as young, healthy adults
- Persian-speaking communities in Beverly Hills may miss critical information in English-only alerts

Current systems ignore these differences, potentially putting lives at risk."

## Live Demo Walkthrough (90 seconds)

### Demo Part 1: High-Income, Multi-Lingual Community (45 seconds)

**Action:** Enter ZIP 90210 (Beverly Hills, CA)

**Narration:**
"Let me show you how it works. I'll enter 90210 - Beverly Hills, California.

[System generates alert]

Notice what Claude AI did here:
- Detected Persian as a primary language (18% of speakers)
- Provided translations in Persian AND Spanish
- Adapted language complexity for a highly educated audience
- Generated specific wildfire guidance relevant to hillside homes

[Click language toggle to Persian]

The entire message is professionally translated, not just machine-translated phrases."

### Demo Part 2: Low-Income, Spanish-Speaking Community (45 seconds)

**Action:** Close alert, enter ZIP 90022 (East Los Angeles)

**Narration:**
"Now watch how it adapts. Same system, but ZIP 90022 - East Los Angeles.

[System generates alert]

Look at the differences:
- Primary language is Spanish (82% of community)
- Reading level is simpler - 6th grade vs. 10th grade
- Special considerations for the 32% children in this area
- Focus on community resources and transit evacuation (lower car ownership)

[Toggle to Spanish]

The system automatically prioritized Spanish and simplified the language complexity."

## Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

**Key Features:**
"Behind the scenes:
- **Claude API** analyzes real demographic data: languages, income, age, education, geography
- Generates culturally appropriate messaging in seconds
- Provides actionable checklist with progress tracking
- Includes vulnerability-specific guidance for elderly, children, and disabled individuals
- Falls back gracefully if API fails - no one is left without information"

---

## Impact & Future Vision (30 seconds)

**Closing:**
"This demo uses 10 ZIP codes, but imagine scaling this nationwide:
- Every community receives alerts in their primary language
- Reading levels adapt to education demographics
- Special needs populations get targeted guidance
- Integration with existing emergency systems like FEMA, NOAA, and local authorities

The technology exists today. We can make emergency alerts truly accessible to everyone.

Thank you - I'm happy to take questions."

## Anticipated Q&A Responses

### Q: How does this scale to real-time alerts?
**A:** "The Claude API responds in 2-3 seconds. We can pre-cache demographic data and trigger generation immediately when USGS/NOAA detect disasters. For widespread events, we can batch-process alerts for affected ZIP codes in parallel."

### Q: What about users without internet?
**A:** "Great question. This system is designed to complement existing SMS/broadcast systems. Once generated, alerts can be distributed via SMS, radio, TV crawls, and outdoor warning systems. The internet is only needed for generation, not distribution."

### Q: How do you handle API failures?
**A:** "We've built in fallback logic. If Claude API is unavailable, the system returns a generic but still useful alert in English and Spanish. The goal is 'degrade gracefully' - never leave people without information."

### Q: What's the cost per alert?
**A:** "Claude API costs roughly $0.01-0.03 per alert depending on length. For a nationwide emergency affecting 10 million people, that's $100,000-300,000. Compare that to the cost of a single life lost due to miscommunication - it's a negligible investment."

### Q: Privacy concerns with ZIP codes?
**A:** "ZIP codes are already public information used in emergency systems. We don't collect any personal data - just community-level demographics from the Census Bureau. No individual tracking or data retention."

### Q: Integration with existing systems?
**A:** "This is designed as a middleware layer. Input: ZIP + disaster type. Output: Formatted alert. It can plug into FEMA's Integrated Public Alert system, local 911 centers, or emergency broadcast networks via API."

### Q: Accessibility for screen readers?
**A:** "The frontend uses semantic HTML and ARIA labels. Future iterations will include audio output, high-contrast modes, and direct integration with assistive technologies."

## Demo Tips

### Before Demo:
1. ✅ Ensure backend server is running (`node server.js`)
2. ✅ Ensure frontend is running (`npm run dev`)
3. ✅ Verify Anthropic API key is set
4. ✅ Test with 90210 and 90022 to preview results
5. ✅ Clear browser cache if needed
6. ✅ Have backup screenshots ready

### During Demo:
- **Speak slowly** - Let the UI load naturally
- **Point to screen** - Highlight key differences between alerts
- **Use contrast** - "Notice THIS in Beverly Hills vs. THIS in East LA"
- **Stay calm** - If API is slow, explain this is real-time generation

### Backup Plan:
- If live demo fails, have pre-recorded screen capture
- If network is down, show screenshots in slide deck
- Always have static examples ready
